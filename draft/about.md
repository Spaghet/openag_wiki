# Farming for the Future

OpenAg is an open-source community building an ecosystem of food technologies to create healthier, more engaging and more inventive food systems.

"Food Computers," as we call them, refer to the controlled environment agriculture devices that the OpenAg community develops. It's a type of device, like a ''PC'' or a ''3D Printer''. Currently, there are three scales of Food Computers - Personal Food Computers, Food Servers, and Food Data Centers. Every time users grow and harvest, they will contribute to a library of [[:Recipe: | Climate Recipes]] that can be used anywhere in the world to grow the best food.
